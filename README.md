# SocketNetworking
This is one of my assignments from CS503, Systems Basics at Drexel University Online.
The program is a simple chat client that connects remotely, via socket programming, to a chat server that the professor had set up on the University computer lab (Tux). The user enters a name that will appear at the beginning of all of their messages on the server. Once connected, the user will see all the messages passed through the server, with the associated user names, in their terminal.
This program is designed to be run in a Unix environment. I use the Cygwin compiler to run it on my Windows64 OS.
